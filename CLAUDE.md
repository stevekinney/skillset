## Architecture Overview

`skillset` is a CLI that compiles a single source root (cwd or `$SKILLSET_DIRECTORY`, containing `skills/`, `agents/`, `mcp-servers.yaml`, `instructions.md`, `hooks.yaml`, and/or `defaults.yaml`) into the per-tool formats for Claude Code and Codex, at user scope (`~/`) or project scope (`--scope project`). See `README.md` for source formats, destinations, templating, and fallback rules; `documentation/ui-readiness.md` for the JSON contracts and ledger design; `.claude/skills/tool-format-reference` for the verified facts about both tools' surfaces.

### Module Layout (`src/`)

- `bin.ts` — executable entry (`skillset` bin); delegates to `cli.ts`.
- `cli.ts` — command dispatch; all IO is injected via `CliDependencies` (cwd, env, homeDirectory, log, optional mcpTransport) so tests run in temp dirs without touching real stdio.
- `invocation.ts` — `node:util` `parseArgs` argument parsing; per-command `--help` text lives in `help.ts`.
- `help.ts` — comprehensive per-command help text (`commandHelp(name)`) plus the top-level `USAGE`.
- `mcp-server.ts` — exposes every CLI operation as an MCP tool (`createMcpServer`) served over stdio (`runMcpServer`); tool results reuse the same JSON shapes as `--json` CLI output.
- `analysis.ts` — discovers + doctor-checks every source kind into one `Analysis`.
- `commands.ts` — `list`/`show`/`new`/`remove`/`get`/`set` CRUD over sources.
- `commands-run.ts` — `sync`, `doctor --targets`, and `import` orchestration.
- `discover.ts` — source-root resolution and enumeration of all six kinds.
- `targets.ts` — `resolveTargets(scope, home, cwd)`: every destination path for both tools at both scopes, plus the ledger path.
- `ledger.ts` — the sync ledger (v2): per-output hashes, timestamps, managed entries; v1 migration; `stableStringify`/`structurallyEqual`.
- `drift.ts` — compares ledger items against disk (`clean`/`drift`/`missing`).
- `frontmatter.ts` — skill union Zod schema, per-target projections, `agents/openai.yaml` derivation, shared `splitFrontmatter`/`isMapping`.
- `agent-frontmatter.ts` / `agent-emit.ts` — agent union schema and Claude `.md` / Codex `.toml` emission.
- `instructions.ts` — instructions.md conditional compile + `@import` checks.
- `template.ts` — `<!-- #if claude/codex -->` conditional processing.
- `fallback.ts` — Codex-only prose rewrites of Claude dynamic features.
- `emit.ts` — skill compilation (frontmatter + body + generated marker + openai.yaml).
- `doctor.ts` — skill and agent validation; errors block sync.
- `mcp-config.ts` / `hooks-config.ts` / `defaults-config.ts` — the three single-file source schemas and their per-target mappings.
- `mcp-apply.ts` / `hooks-apply.ts` / `defaults-apply.ts` — surgical application to the shared config files, entry-level ledger ownership, backups.
- `config-files.ts` — shared JSON config read/write + backup helpers and the `EmbeddedAction` type.
- `toml-splice.ts` — comment-preserving `[section]` and top-level-scalar splicing for `config.toml`.
- `import.ts` — reverse-compiles installed skills/agents/instructions into sources.
- `sync.ts` — plan/execute for the file-based kinds, marker ownership, drift skips, ledger recording.

### Core Design Principles

1. **Environment-First Configuration**: All configuration resolves through `@lostgradient/environmentalist` with a Zod schema in `src/environment.ts` (env vars, dotenv, `skillset.config.*`). The `environment` object is the single source of truth.

2. **Marker + Ledger Ownership**: Sync only overwrites or prunes outputs it can prove it wrote — file outputs carry `GENERATED_MARKER`, config entries live in the ledger (`~/.config/skillset/state.json`) with content hashes. Hand-installed files are skipped as unmanaged; hand-edited managed outputs are skipped as drifted; both need `--force`.

3. **Runtime-Neutral Published Code**: `src/` must not use Bun-only runtime APIs (`Bun.file`, `Bun.env`, `Bun.serve`, etc.). Those APIs are fine in `scripts/` and test files, but must not appear in published library output.

### Key Notes

- **ESM + TypeScript**: Source files are TypeScript modules; build output targets both Node and Bun.
- **Import paths**: Use standard TS/ESM imports; no `@/*` path alias (it leaks into `.d.ts` files).
- **Library output**: Dual-emit — `dist/node/` for Node consumers, `dist/bun/` for Bun consumers. The `exports` map routes consumers automatically.

### Library Packaging

The build produces:

- `dist/node/index.js` — ESM bundle, `Bun.build target: 'node'`, all deps external
- `dist/bun/index.js` — ESM bundle, `Bun.build target: 'bun'`, all deps external
- `dist/index.d.ts` — TypeScript declarations (shared)

The `exports` map in `package.json`:

```json
{
  ".": {
    "types": "./dist/index.d.ts",
    "bun": "./dist/bun/index.js",
    "import": "./dist/node/index.js",
    "default": "./dist/node/index.js"
  },
  "./package.json": "./package.json"
}
```

Package validation runs as part of `validate`: `publint` checks the exports map structure and `@arethetypeswrong/cli` checks type resolution across resolution modes.

### Git Hooks Architecture

Hooks are configured in `lefthook.yml` and implemented as Bun TypeScript files under `scripts/hooks/`:

- **pre-commit** (`lefthook.yml`, piped/sequential): formats staged files with Prettier, runs oxlint --fix on staged files, blocks staged conflict markers, and checks `bun.lock` is staged when `package.json` changes. Fast by design; skipped during merge/rebase.
- **pre-push** (`lefthook.yml`): runs full `bun run validate`; skipped in CI.
- **post-checkout** (`scripts/hooks/post-checkout.ts`): installs deps when `bun.lock` changes; surfaces config changes. Silent when nothing actionable changed.
- **post-merge** (`scripts/hooks/post-merge.ts`): installs/cleans when dependencies or config changed; flags leftover conflict markers. Silent when nothing actionable changed.

Hooks print only on failure (`output: [failure, execution_out]` in `lefthook.yml`), so a clean commit/push stays quiet. The TypeScript hook scripts use `chalk` for color, `change-case` for headings, and Bun's `$` and `Bun.write` for shell/IO.

### Claude Code Hooks

`.claude/settings.json` wires up two project-level Claude Code hooks (scripts in `.claude/hooks/`):

- **format-on-edit** (`PostToolUse` on `Edit`/`Write`): runs `prettier --write --ignore-unknown` on the file Claude just edited, so edits always match the project style and never trip the format gate. Fail-safe — no-ops if Prettier isn't installed yet.
- **protect-env** (`PreToolUse` on `Write`): blocks writes to `.env` / `.env.*` (except `.env.example`) so secrets aren't clobbered. Edit those files manually.

Both scripts exit 0 (no-op) when their dependencies are missing, so a freshly cloned template never breaks a session.

### Types

There is no shared `src/types.ts` in this template. Add shared or domain-specific types near their modules as needed.

## Development Patterns

### Adding New Features

1. **Environment variables**: Add to `.env.example` first, then update the schema in `src/environment.ts`.
2. **Types**: Domain-specific types live near their modules.

### Testing Approach

- Tests use Bun's built-in test runner with `describe`, `it`, `expect`.
- Test files are colocated with sources using the `.test.ts` suffix.
- `test/setup.ts` is preloaded by `bunfig.toml` — it resets mocks and system time in `afterEach`. All tests get this automatically.
- Oxlint rules are relaxed for test files. You can use `any`, non-null assertions, and other patterns normally flagged.
- A separate `tsconfig.test.json` provides relaxed TypeScript settings for tests (checked by `bun run typecheck:test`).
- Coverage threshold is 100% for `src/`. Run `bun test --coverage` to see the report.

### Import Organization

Keep imports in this order:

1. Bun built-ins (e.g., `import { file, write } from 'bun'`)
2. Node built-ins (e.g., `import { readFile } from 'node:fs'`)
3. External packages (e.g., `import { z } from 'zod'`)
4. Relative imports (e.g., `./local-module`)

No path alias (`@/*`) — use relative imports everywhere.

## Bun-Specific Considerations

- Always use `bun` commands, not `npm` or `yarn`.
- The lockfile in this repo is `bun.lock`.
- Bun provides native TypeScript execution without precompilation.
- For one-off package execution, use `bun x` for packages already in `devDependencies` rather than `bunx`, which can pull remote versions.

### Prefer Bun Built-ins Over Node

When possible, use Bun's native APIs in `scripts/` and tests. Do not use them in `src/` — published code must be Node-compatible.

| Task          | Use (Bun)                                | Avoid (Node)                     |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Read file     | `Bun.file(path).text()`                  | `fs.readFileSync(path, 'utf-8')` |
| Write file    | `Bun.write(path, data)`                  | `fs.writeFileSync(path, data)`   |
| HTTP server   | `Bun.serve()`                            | `http.createServer()` or Express |
| Hashing       | `Bun.hash()` or `new Bun.CryptoHasher()` | `crypto.createHash()`            |
| Spawn process | `Bun.spawn()` or `Bun.$`                 | `child_process.spawn()`          |
| Sleep         | `Bun.sleep(ms)`                          | `setTimeout` with promisify      |
| Environment   | `Bun.env.VAR`                            | `process.env.VAR`                |
| Glob          | `Bun.Glob`                               | `glob` package                   |

When a Bun equivalent doesn't exist or Node's API is more appropriate, use the `node:` prefix for clarity (e.g., `import { join } from 'node:path'`).

### Configuration Notes

- **bunfig.toml**: Configures the `.md` text loader, forces Bun runtime for scripts, and sets up `bun test` with preload, coverage, and 100% thresholds.
- **TypeScript**: Uses Bun types; Node type libs are not included by default.
- **Oxlint**: Rust-based linter with built-in TypeScript, promise, unicorn, and import plugins. Type-aware rules enabled via `--type-aware --tsconfig ./tsconfig.json`. Test files have relaxed rules.
- **Testing**: Run tests in parallel via `bun test --parallel`.
